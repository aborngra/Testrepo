# Table API Generator

*This generator is a standalone PL/SQL package which creates table API's for existing tables. It can be integrated in the Oracle SQL-Developer with an additional wrapper package for the [oddgen][0] extension. The effort of generated API's is to reduce your PL/SQL code by calling standard procedures and functions for usual DML operations on tables. So the generated table APIs work as a logical layer between your business logic and the data. And by the way this logical layer enables you to easily seperate the data schema and the UI schema for your applications to improve security by granting only execute privs on table APIs to the application scheme. In addition to that table APIs will speed up your development cycles because developers are able to set the focal point to the business logic instead of wasting time by manual creating boilerplate code for your tables.*

> Avoid hard-coding SQL ([Steven Feuerstein][2])


## Features

- Generates small wrappers around your tables
- You only need to specify generation options once per table - parameters are saved in the package spec source and can be reused for regeneration
- Standard CRUD methods (column and row type based) with an additional create or update version
- Getter and setter for each column
- A primary key based row exists boolean function and a row exists_yn varchar2 function that can be used in PL/SQL or SQL context
- per unique constraint a getter function to fetch the primary key by each unique constraint (single or multicolumn)
- Delete / Insert / Update of rows can be enabled or disabled e.g. to avoid deletion because of violation of referential integrity
- Optional generic logging (one log entry for each changed column over all API enabled schema tables in one generic log table - very handy to create a record history in the user interface)
- Checks for real changes during UPDATE operation and updates only if required
- Supports APEX automatic row processing by generation of an optional updatable view with an instead of trigger, which calls simply the API and if enabled - the generic logging

## Naming Conventions

The generator is creating the following objects for each table during the compilation phase (with the create or replace clause):

- #TABLE_NAME_26#_API: The API package itself
- #TABLE_NAME_24#_DML_V: A DML view, mainly a helper for APEX tabular forms
- #TABLE_NAME_24#_IOIUD: Instead of trigger on the DML view, which calls simply the table API

Additionally the generator is creating once in a schema a generic change log table if you set the parameter p_enable_generic_change_log to true:

- GENERIC_CHANGE_LOG: The table itself
- GENERIC_CHANGE_LOG_SEQ: The sequence
- GENERIC_CHANGE_LOG_PK: The primary key index
- GENERIC_CHANGE_LOG_IDX: An additional index

The generator is checking by itself, if the corresponding sequence and index names are already in use in the schema. If it is the case, an error is raised.

We think currently about a new parameter to enable or disable the generation of the view and the trigger. Not all of the projects require updatable DML views and you can also use the API methods on a tabular form directly (but the wizard driven tabular form creation is easier to implement with the DML view).

If you want to check if generated objects with their names already exist before the very first API compilation, you can use this pipelined table function:

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM TABLE(your_install_schema.om_tapigen.view_naming_conflicts);
```

We give our best to produce clean and robust code, but we are NOT responsible, if you loose any code or data by using this API generator. By using it you accept the MIT license as described above. As a best practice test this generator first in your development environment and decide after your tests, if you want to use it in production. If you miss any feature or find a bug, we are happy to hear from you via the GitHub [issues][5] functionality.


## How To Use

1. Install the package om_tapigen in your schema, or even better in a central tools schema and grant execute rights to public
2. Optional install the wrapper package for the SQL Developer integration (don't forget to install the [oddgen][0] extension)
3. Create your API's :-)


### PL/SQL

```sql
begin
  --> minimal parameter, see also the section "The Parameters"
  your_install_schema.om_tapigen.compile_api (p_table_name => 'EMP');
end;
```

#### The Methods

There are three methods - all have the same parameters:

1. compile_api: This procedure generates the code and compiles it directly
2. compile_api_and_get_code: This functions does the same as the previous procedure and returns additionally the generated code as a clob
3. get_code: This function only returns the code as a clob (this is the function called by the oddgen wrapper for the SQL Developer integration)

There is also a pipelined function to view the current status of the API's and the original parameter values from the generation call:

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM TABLE(your_install_schema.om_tapigen.view_existing_apis)
 ORDER BY table_name NULLS FIRST;
```

The leading dictionary information is the API package name. It could be, you found API's where the table_name is NULL - this means your API is existing, but your table not anymore. Thats the reason for the order by clause in the example query. You can use this pipelined function for quality assurance or for building a metadata repository with the generation parameters of your API's. It also used by the second helper method, a procedure to recreate all existing API's at once with the original parameter values in case of changes in your data model:

```sql
BEGIN
  your_install_schema.om_tapigen.recreate_existing_apis;
END;
```

As you can see, you need no parameters for this procedure - they are taken from the dictionary user source, because we save it as a comment in the package specification. If you ask, why not use package constants we want ask you: Have you already tried to read a package constant when the package is invalid because of changes in your corresponding table... ;-)


#### The Parameters

1. p_table_name: string, mandatory
2. p_reuse_existing_api_params: boolean, default true
    - If true, all following parameters are ignored, if the generator can find the original parameters in the package specification of the existing API - for new API's this parameter is ignored and the following parameters are used
    - If false, the generator ignores any existing API options and you are able to redefine the parameters
3. p_col_prefix_in_method_names: boolean, default true
    - The generator is generally shorten your column names to 26 characters to build the names for the column based getter and setter methods (get_xxx, set_xxx)
    - If true, the generator does no other modifications
    - If false, the generator tries to find a unique column prefix for all the colums in your table
        - If he find one, this column prefix is first deleted from your column name before building the short name with 26 characters
        - If he could not find a column prefix, then the generator throws an exception (should we simple ignore this? let us know...)
4. p_enable_insertion_of_rows: boolean, default true
    - selfexplanatory, isn't it?
    - If true, create_row procedure and function is generated
	- If true and parameter p_enable_update_of_rows is true, create_or_update_row procedure and function is generated
	- If false, create_row and create_or_update_row procedure and function is NOT generated
	- If false, the corresponding DML view(#TABLE_NAME_24#_DML_V) instead of trigger (#TABLE_NAME_24#_IOIUD) raises an exception on an insert attempt
5. p_enable_update_of_rows: boolean, default true
    - selfexplanatory, isn't it?
    - If true, update_row procedure is generated
	- If true and parameter p_enable_insertion_of_rows is true, create_or_update_row procedure and function is generated
	- If false, create_row and create_or_update_row procedure and function is NOT generated
	- If false, setter procedures for each columns are NOT generated
	- If false, the corresponding DML view(#TABLE_NAME_24#_DML_V) instead of trigger (#TABLE_NAME_24#_IOIUD) raises an exception on an update attempt
6. p_enable_deletion_of_rows: boolean, default false
    - selfexplanatory, isn't it?
    - If true, a delete_row procedure is generated
    - If false, the delete_row procedure is NOT generated 
	- If false, the corresponding DML view(#TABLE_NAME_24#_DML_V) instead of trigger (#TABLE_NAME_24#_IOIUD) raises an exception on a delete attempt
7. p_enable_generic_change_log: boolean, default false
    - If true, one log entry is created for each changed column over all API enabled schema tables in one generic log table - very handy to create a record history in the user interface
        - The table generic_change_log and a corresponding sequence generic_change_log_seq is created in the schema during the API creation on the very first API that uses this feature
        - We could long describe this feature - try it out in your development system and decide, if you want to have it or not
        - One last thing: This could NOT replace a historicization, but can deliver things, that would not so easy with a historicization - we use both sometimes together...
8. p_sequence_name: string, default NULL
    - If a sequence name is given here, then the resulting API is taken the ID for the create_row methods and you don't need to create a trigger for your table only for the sequence handling
    - you can use the following substitution strings, the generator is replacing this at runtime: #TABLE_NAME_24#, #TABLE_NAME_26#, #TABLE_NAME_28#, #PK_COLUMN_26#, #PK_COLUMN_28#, #COLUMN_PREFIX#
        - Example 1: #TABLE_NAME_26#_SEQ
        - Example 2: SEQ_#PK_COLUMN_26#
        - Example 3: #COLUMN_PREFIX#_SEQ
		

Finally a complete PL/SQL example with all default parameter values:

```sql
--> check for possible naming conflicts
SELECT *
  FROM TABLE(your_install_schema.om_tapigen.view_naming_conflicts);

--> initial API generation for your tables
BEGIN
  FOR i IN (SELECT table_name FROM user_tables /*WHERE...*/) LOOP
    your_install_schema.om_tapigen.compile_api(
      p_table_name                 => i.table_name,
      p_reuse_existing_api_params  => TRUE,
      p_col_prefix_in_method_names => TRUE,
      p_enable_deletion_of_rows    => FALSE,
      p_enable_generic_change_log  => FALSE,
      p_sequence_name              => NULL);  
  END LOOP;
END;

--> inspect the results
SELECT *
  FROM TABLE(your_install_schema.om_tapigen.view_existing_apis)
 ORDER BY table_name NULLS FIRST;

--> recreate the API's after changes in your model
BEGIN
  your_install_schema.om_tapigen.recreate_existing_apis;
END;
```

If you want only generate the code, you can do it like so:

```sql
DECLARE
  v_clob CLOB;
BEGIN
  FOR i IN (SELECT table_name FROM user_tables) LOOP
    v_clob := your_install_schema.om_tapigen.get_code(
      p_table_name => i.table_name);  
    dbms_xslprocessor.clob2file(
      v_clob,
      '<your_directory>',
      substr(i.table_name, 1, 26) || '_API.sql');
  END LOOP;
END;
```


### SQL Developer

Please install first the [oddgen][0] extension. Our wrapper package is autodiscovered by this extension.

![SQL Developer Integration][3]


### Recommended Fastest Way To Your API's

1. Check naming conflicts in your schema before the first API compilation
    - `SELECT * FROM TABLE(your_install_schema.om_tapigen.view_naming_conflicts);`
2. Use SQL Developer for the first API creation (you can create API's for multiple tables at once - see screenshot above: emp and dept)
3. Inspect and run the generated code as a script, then save it to your version control system for the deployment
4. View the state of all existing API's
    - `SELECT * FROM TABLE(your_install_schema.om_tapigen.view_existing_apis);`
5. On model changes recreate all existing API's with the original parameters
    - `BEGIN your_install_schema.om_tapigen.recreate_existing_apis; END;`

## Credits

We want to say thank you to Phillip Salvisberg and all other people behind the [oddgen][0] project for this great generic SQL Developer extension. Also big thanks to Steven Feuerstein for his engagement to tell PL/SQL Developers, what a good coding practice is. We hope he find not so much bad practice in our generator, if he ever takes a look at it ;-)


## Changelog

This project uses [semantic versioning][5].

Please use for all comments, discussions, feature requests or bug reports the GitHub [issues][4] functionality.

### 0.4.0 (2017-01-10)
#### new generated API functions / procedures
- adding a **row_exists_yn** function that returns 'Y' or 'N' varchar2 type as an extension of the boolean based **row_exists** function (to allow checking a row within SQL context)
- adding additional **read_row** functions that takes unique constraint columns as parameter and returns the row, for each unique constraint one read_row function
- **new INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE parameter** for fine granular definition, which DML operations are allowed on the table
- **new DML view parameter** that decides whether or not to create an updatable DML View as a logical layer between APEX and the database table
- DML view trigger additionally catches unallowed DML operations and throws exceptions in dependency of **new INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE parameter**

#### code optimizations
- getter functions for each column: remove unnecessary variable declaration (variable v_return)
- setter functions for each column: remove unnecessary variable declaration (variable v_#column_name#)
- limit clause for bulk collect operations introduced to avoid session memory conflicts

#### other stuff
- added some additional comments on internal procedures and functions
- PL/SQL Doc for generated API Packages 
- renaming internal variables more consistently
- supporting special column names, because column names are written in quotes now
